We're working on an application in active development, built using Python. In a CI (Continuous Integration) setup, some common steps are linting, testing, and building the project. In the Python ecosystem, we have tools that are widely used and easy to integrate. For linting, flake8 and pylint are popular choices. They help keep code style consistent and catch bugs early. For testing, pytest is a go-to tool — it’s powerful, has great plugin support, and is easy to write tests with. As for building, Python doesn’t require compilation in the same way as Java or C++, but we can package our app with tools like setuptools, or use tox to automate testing across environments.

When it comes to setting up CI, Jenkins and GitHub Actions are well-known, but there are other solid options. GitLab CI is a strong alternative, especially if you're already using GitLab for version control. CircleCI and Travis CI are also widely used, with good integration and simple setup. Some teams even use cloud services like AWS CodePipeline or Azure DevOps for CI/CD pipelines.

Whether this setup should be in a self-hosted or cloud-based environment depends on a few factors. If the team has strict security requirements or deals with sensitive data, self-hosting might be better, since you have full control over the infrastructure. However, cloud-based solutions are easier to maintain, scale automatically, and are usually faster to set up — ideal for small teams like ours. To decide properly, we'd need to know more about budget, deployment preferences, security policies, and whether the app needs to run behind a firewall or not.
